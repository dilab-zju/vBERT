an O
efficient O

that O
capture O

we O
show O
in O

that O
our O
approach B-Generic
significantly O
outperforms O

In O

we O
show O
how O
the O
lack B-OtherScientificTerm

temporal B-OtherScientificTerm

To O
avoid O
this O

we O
augment O
the O

model I-Method
with O
a O

temporal I-OtherScientificTerm

increases O
the O

Fortunately O
, O
an O
intermediate B-OtherScientificTerm

could O
often O
be O

to O
build O
a O

Specifically O
, O
we O
design O
two O

one B-Generic

the O

To O

we O
incorporate O

which O
tends O

Extensive O
experiments O
on O
two O
tasks B-Generic
have O
demonstrated O
the O
superiority O
of O
our O
method B-Generic
over O
the O
state-of-the-art B-Generic
methods I-Generic
. O

Basically O
, O
a O
set O
of O
age-group B-Method
specific I-Method
dictionaries I-Method
are O
learned O
, O
where O
the O
dictionary B-OtherScientificTerm
bases I-OtherScientificTerm
corresponding O
to O
the O
same O
index O
yet O
from O
different O
dictionaries O
form O
a O
particular O
aging B-OtherScientificTerm
process I-OtherScientificTerm
pattern I-OtherScientificTerm
cross O
different O
age O
groups O
, O
and O
a O
linear B-Method
combination I-Method
of O
these O
patterns B-Generic
expresses O
a O
particular O
personalized B-Task
aging I-Task
process I-Task
. O

Moreover O
, O
two O
factors O
are O
taken O
into O
consideration O
in O
the O
dictionary B-Method
learning I-Method
process I-Method
. O

Second O
, O
it O
is O
challenging O
or O
even O
impossible O
to O
collect O
faces O
of O
all O
age O
groups O
for O
a O
particular O
subject O
, O
yet O
much O
easier O
and O
more O
practical O
to O
get O
face O
pairs O
from O
neighboring O
age O
groups O
. O

Thus O
a O
personality-aware B-OtherScientificTerm
coupled I-OtherScientificTerm
reconstruction I-OtherScientificTerm

is O
utilized O
to O
learn O
the O
dictionaries B-Generic
based O
on O

from O
neighboring O
age O

. O

We O
propose O
a O

formalizing O
the O
structure B-OtherScientificTerm

The O

In O

techniques I-Method
can O
be O
applied O
to O

This O

Moreover O
, O
fluorescence B-OtherScientificTerm

wavelength-shifting I-OtherScientificTerm

Our O

the O
dilemma O
that O

Our O

While O
such O

an O

We O
first O
uniformly O
partition O

we O
incre-mentally O
merge O

an O

The O

We O

Currently O

and O
the O
second B-Generic
approach I-Generic
is O
to O
compute O
exact O
EIoU B-OtherScientificTerm
but O
only O
over O
a O
small O

We O
begin O
