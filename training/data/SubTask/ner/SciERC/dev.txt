The O

The O

The O

To O

The O

correct O

thus O
improve O
the O

We O
consider O
the O
case O
of O
multi-document B-Task
summarization I-Task
, O
where O
the O
input O
documents O
are O
in O
Arabic B-Material

We O
demonstrate O
how O

In O
this O
paper O
, O
we O
propose O
a O
new O
approach B-Generic
to O
generate O

object I-Task
proposals I-Task
-LRB- I-Task
OOPs I-Task
-RRB- I-Task
to O
reduce O
the O
detection B-Metric
error I-Metric
caused O
by O
various O
orientations B-OtherScientificTerm
of I-OtherScientificTerm
the I-OtherScientificTerm
object I-OtherScientificTerm
. O

To O
this O
end O
, O
we O
propose O
to O
efficiently O
locate O
object B-OtherScientificTerm
regions I-OtherScientificTerm
according O
to O
pixelwise B-OtherScientificTerm
object I-OtherScientificTerm
probability I-OtherScientificTerm
, O
rather O
than O
measuring O
the O

from O
a O
set O
of O

. O

We O
formulate O
the O
proposal B-Task

problem I-Task
as O
a O
generative B-Method
proba-bilistic I-Method
model I-Method
such O
that O
object B-OtherScientificTerm
proposals I-OtherScientificTerm

different O

i.e. O

be O
produced O
by O

The O
new O
approach B-Generic
has O
three O
main O
advantages O
. O

First O
, O
it B-Generic
helps O
the O
object B-Method
detector I-Method
handle O
objects O
of O
different O

. O

Second O
, O
as O
the O
shapes B-OtherScientificTerm
of I-OtherScientificTerm
the I-OtherScientificTerm
proposals I-OtherScientificTerm
may O
vary O
to O
fit O
the O
objects O
, O
the O
resulting O
proposals O
are O
tighter O
than O
the O
sampling B-OtherScientificTerm
windows I-OtherScientificTerm
with O
fixed O
sizes O
. O

Third O
, O
it B-Generic
avoids O
massive B-Method
window I-Method
sampling I-Method
, O
and O
thereby O
reducing O
the O
number B-OtherScientificTerm
of I-OtherScientificTerm
proposals I-OtherScientificTerm
while O
maintaining O
a O
high O
recall B-Metric
. O

Experiments O

that O
the O
proposed O
OOP B-Method
outperforms O
the O

. O

Further O
experiments O
show O
that O
the O
rotation B-OtherScientificTerm

property I-OtherScientificTerm
helps O
a O

achieve O
better O
